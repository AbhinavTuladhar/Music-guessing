# Music Guessing Game

A minor CLI program to guess the name of a music track.

**REQUIRED** Install the 64-bit version of VLC media player, since this is used for playing sound. There are definitely alternatives which do not require the installation of VLC media player, though.

## To use:

Make a root folder (let's call this "MUSIC") and place as many folders and .mp3 files you like within the MUSIC folder which will be used in the guessing game. 

When running the program, it'll throw you in an infinite loop of guessing the track name of an x-second segment. The length of the sgement and the time interval for guessing can be configured. However, scores have to be kept track of mentally :P
